world,WHO urges Ukraine to destroy laboratory pathogens,12 March,"The WHO said on Friday that it urged Ukraine to destroy any highly dangerous pathogens in its laboratories to avoid the risk of an outbreak as Russian attacks in the country continue.The World Health Organization said its remit included promoting biosafety in laboratories to prevent the accidental or deliberate release of pathogens.“As part of this work, the WHO has strongly recommended the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and other responsible agencies to destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent potential spills,” the UN health agency said.Mindful of the concern that the recommendation could raise, after Ukraine’s main civilian nuclear power plant was affected by the Russian invasion, WHO highlighted the broader context of years of collaboration with the Ukrainian authorities to improve laboratory safety..“WHO routinely helps member states improve their public health capabilities, including by facilitating greater safety and security of laboratories containing samples of pathogens of public health concern,” the organization said.“The WHO country office in Ukraine has been working for several years with the Ministry of Health and other partners, including other WHO member states, to support the improvement of biosafety and biosecurity of laboratories, as well as the capacity of laboratory staff, in particular to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.”In its general recommendations on laboratory safety, the WHO emphasizes a risk-based assessment, spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva via video link from Ukraine.“Laboratories should always investigate and assess the situation they are in, to ensure that in the event of a threat, there is a way to safely remove pathogens that are typically found in all of these countries for public health and safety purposes. to avoid any accident. spill,” he said.“It is part of us to provide public health advice to all countries to try to ensure that there is minimal risk of any harm to the population due to a possible accidental release of pathogens.”Questioned by AFP, the WHO did not provide a list of laboratories in Ukraine, nor did it indicate their level of biosafety or explain what pathogens they had.Jasarevic could not say whether any laboratories affected by these recommendations were in an area actively bombed or occupied by Russian troops.

world,Amsterdam hostage taker asked for 200 million in cryptocurrencies,24 Feb,"A man who held several people hostage at an Apple store in Amsterdam demanded 200 million euros ($230 million) in cryptocurrency before he was taken to hospital “seriously injured,” police said Wednesday.The man, identified as a 27-year-old from Amsterdam, entered the Apple Store with a firearm in the busy Leidseplein neighborhood on Tuesday afternoon, sparking a tense five-hour ordeal.The camouflage-clad assailant reportedly took one man, a 44-year-old British citizen, hostage while four others hid in a cupboard.It was initially feared that the suspect was holding several people hostage, but he was reportedly unaware that several other people were hiding in the building.In a press conference overnight, Police Chief Frank Paauw said that the suspect demanded 200 million in cryptocurrency before he was finally apprehended by police.The ordeal finally ended around 10:30 am (21:30 GMT) when the hostage asked for water. He left the building and then ran, prompting the suspect to chase after him.The suspect was then hit hard by a police car before being checked for explosives by a robot as he lay on the road, painted by the laser sights of police snipers.“A special forces car reacted very appropriately and alertly,” Paauw said, praising the hostage for his bravery.“The hostage has played a hero role. In a split second, he escaped from this hostage situation, otherwise it would have been an even longer and more unpleasant night.”Around 70 people in total were evacuated from the building and the area around the store was cordoned off.The suspect was taken to hospital “seriously injured,” Paauw said, and investigations into the incident are ongoing.Police received a call around 5:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) on Tuesday about a gunman at the Apple Store, and footage suggested he may have been wearing an explosive vest.Several special police units were deployed and the first to arrive were attacked with an automatic weapon, Paauw said.He later tweeted that the man had no explosives on him.All Apple stores in the Netherlands were closed on Wednesday, and the site where the hostages were taken on Tuesday will remain closed on Thursday, the company said.Leidseplein is popular with tourists and known for its lively bars and cafes. The area was quickly put on lockdown and restaurants, bars and theaters were closed after the hostage taking.\",https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAUcy2R.img?h=630&w=1200&m=6&q=60&o=t&l=f&f=jpg,news lodge
world,Saied of Tunisia declares ‘war’ against food speculation,9 March,"Tunisian President Kais Saied declared war on food speculators on Wednesday amid shortages of products such as wheat and semolina, key staples in a country already mired in political-economic crisis.The Russian invasion of Ukraine has threatened staple food supplies, particularly wheat that many Arab countries import mainly from the two Eastern European nations.Saied announced that he was launching a “relentless war against speculators and criminals”, accusing them of seeking to “hit peace and social security”, in a statement from the presidency.Saied had previously announced that he was working on legislation introducing prison sentences as punishment for speculation and food speculation.Tunisia has experienced severe shortages of staple foods such as rice, semolina, sugar and flour in recent weeks, with authorities frequently announcing the seizure of illegally stored quantities of these foods.Tunisia remains mired in economic and political crisis eight months after Saied seized extraordinary powers, dissolving parliament and suspending the government.The Russian invasion of Ukraine poses a threat to food supplies to Tunisia, which imports about half of its wheat from Ukraine and relies on foreign countries for much of its food supplies.The North African country began talks in February with the International Monetary Fund about a possible multibillion-dollar bailout for the country’s crisis-hit economy.The lender has called for “deep reforms” and cuts in public spending, having previously raised concerns about Tunisia’s budget deficits and, in particular, the public sector wage bill.",https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2022/02/22/cce16002-8353-4571-bba7-5367c0f77a88/cce16002-8353-4571-bba7-5367c0f77a88.jpg?crop=4:3&width=1200,news lodge
world,Queen Elizabeth: Jubilee tributes pour in for oldest female monarch,7 Feb,"Tributes from around the world have continued to pour in for the longest-serving female monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, who marked 70 years on the throne yesterday.The queen is the first British monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee and will spend the day in private.The Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, her first child, while paying tribute to the Queen for marking 70 years on the throne, said in a statement: “The Queen’s devotion to the welfare of all her people inspires even greater admiration. with each passing step. year.”Many more have congratulated the Queen on this historic day, including Boris Johnson, Theresa May and David Cameron, three of the 14 British Prime Ministers who held number 10 during her reign.Johnson said, “I pay tribute to his many years of service and look forward to coming together as a country to celebrate his historic reign this summer.”Her predecessor, Mrs May, described the monarch as “an extraordinary woman, who has dedicated her life to serving her people and our family of nations”.Cameron said, “There can be no better example of duty and worthy public service.”Opposition Leader Sir Keir Starmer echoed these sentiments, saying he would like to express his “deepest thanks” for 70 years of “unrivaled public service”.The Labor leader added: “Her Majesty the Queen has been a vital and valuable constant in an ever-changing world, representing the security and stability of our country, through the ups and downs of the last seven decades.”The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, also praised the queen “for her dedication to all of us and her faithful witness to Jesus Christ.”In addition, the Head of the Strategic and Security Studies Division of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Dr. Joshua Bolarinwa, said that the 70-year reign of Queen Elizabeth II showed her intention to facilitate decolonization, especially in the annual stage.“Her desire to end colonization made her visit Africa and other countries where Britain had colonies,” he said.She noted that when she came to Nigeria, her intention was to give the nation its independence, but the politicians were not ready at the time, which stalled independence until 1960. When she came to Ghana, they were ready for it, for That’s why they got their independence before Nigeria.Politically, the queen has had a huge impact on development and multilateral diplomacy in Africa and around the world.However, he noted that the Queen, as head of the Commonwealth, has much more work to do, as wealth is not distributed equally among the nations in the association.According to him, initially the membership of the Commonwealth was limited to the former colonies of Great Britain, but around 2008 it became an all-stakeholder affair, which affected the power of the body.“Even Nigeria hasn’t been really serious about the Commonwealth, like it is about AU and ECOWAS summits and functions.“It is necessary to assess the reason that brought them together as a multilateral international organization,” he added.Bolarinwa called on the queen to enhance beneficial relations between the Commonwealth countries.He stressed the need to share benefits and technicalities across the board, adding that technology should be shared or sold.He pointed out that apart from Britain, Australia and Canada, none of their colonies, particularly in Africa, have developed adequately.He added that Nigeria-UK should be visa-free due to the benefits that Britain gained from the country.Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was not born to wear the crown.

technology,Facebook Modifies Hate Speech Rule To Allow “Violent” Content Toward Russian Authorities,March 12,"The Russia-Ukraine conflict has for the past few weeks seen major government powerhouses and nations condemn the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. It saw series of sanctions meted against Russia, one of them is majority of global tech companies halting their operations in the Putin-led country.
Meta, one of the tech platforms that had placed sanctions on Russia in the wake of the assault on Ukraine has on Thursday modified its approach to hate speech by allowing violent comments on its platforms targeted at Russian authorities.The Facebook-parent company said it would allow on its platforms comments such as “death to Russian invaders” but not credible threats against civilians. This as expected drew the ire of Russian authorities, with the Russian embassy in the U.S. on Friday urging that Washington stop the “extremist activities” of platform.The relaxation Meta’s hate speech rule included permission for calls for the killing of Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, provided they don’t have threats toward others or “indicators of credibility” like saying where or how the act will take place.The infuriated Russian Embassy in the U.S in a statement reacting to the decision by Meta said:“Meta’s criminal and aggressive leading to the provocation of hostility and hatred towards Russians is outrageous. The company’s actions are yet another evidence of the information war without rules declared on our country.” But Meta Inc remained unfazed with the backlash from the Russian quarters as it defended its policy decision through a statement by its spokesperson Andy Stone. In the words of Stone:“The Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in the company temporarily making allowances for forms of political expression that would break our rules like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders. We still won’t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians.”  This policy applies to Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary, the report confirmed.",https://i0.wp.com/techbooky.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/123633679_mediaitem123633678.jpg?w=976&ssl=1,techbooky
technology,Russia Will Ban Instagram In The Days Ahead,March 12,"Russia’s Communications Agency, Roskpmnadzor has announced the ban of video and picture platform, Instagramfrom the country, effective March 14, 2022. This coming just a week after it banned its sister platform, Facebook after it accused the social media giant of ‘discriminating against theRussian media’.The Russian authorities while justifying the addition of Instagram to the ban premised its decision on Meta’s decision to modify its hate speech rule to allow posts and comments calling for violence against Russian authorities.The Russian agency in a statement announcing the ban of Instagram said:“As you know, on March 11, Meta Platforms Inc. made an unprecedented decision by allowing the posting of information containing calls for violence against Russian citizens on its social networks Facebook and Instagram.“Messages are circulating on the Instagram social network encouraging and provoking violent acts against Russians, in connection with which the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office demanded that Roskomnadzor restrict access to this social network.“Since it will take time for active Instagram users to transfer their photo and video materials to other social networks and notify their contacts and subscribers, Roskomnadzor decided to complete the procedure for imposing restrictions on access to Instagram at 00:00 on March 14, providing users with an additional 48 hours of transition period.“The government’s decision does not mention that Russian oligarchs have used Instagram to speak out against the invasion. In some instances, this extends to the children of oligarchs who have become influencers with large followings like Sofia Abramovich, daughter of billionaire Roman Abramovich, who reportedly shared a message saying, “the biggest and most successful lie of Kremlin’s propaganda is that most Russians stand with Putin.” Banker Oleg Tinkov, who was at one point the 15th-wealthiest person in Russia, is one of the most notable dissenters with a post that ended by saying, “We are against this war!”Instagram Head, Adam Mosseri while responding to the ban in a tweet said that: “This decision will cut 80 million in Russia off from one another and from the rest of the world as ~80% of people in Russia follow an Instagram account outside their country. This is wrong.”On Monday, Instagram will be blocked in Russia. This decision will cut 80 million in Russia off from one another and from the rest of the world as ~80% of people in Russia follow an Instagram account outside their country. This is wrong.The Instagram ban which will be effective from March 14th will not affect WhatsApp, another Meta-owned platform, according to Russian state-owned media agency RIA Novosti.Nick Clegg, Meta’s Global Affairs President in a statement on Friday said the policies of the Mark Zuckerberg-owned company were “focused on protecting people’s right to speech as an expression of self-defense in reaction to a military invasion of their country.” Clegg said if Meta/Instagram applied its standing policies without adjustment “we would now be removing content from ordinary Ukrainians expressing their resistance and fury” to the Russian invasion, “which would rightly be viewed as unacceptable.”According to Clegg, the temporary policy would apply only within Ukraine itself. “We have no quarrel with the Russian people,” he said adding “we will not tolerate Russophobia or any kind of discrimination, harassment or violence towards Russians on our platform.”",https://i0.wp.com/techbooky.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/787DF9C7-8B7B-425D-9BDC-8FAD27FFF240.jpeg?w=715&ssl=1,techbooky
technology,C Is The Most Environmentally Friendly Programming Language,March 12,"Communication is very important, and the primary means of communication and interaction known to humans is through language. Just like humans communicate, computers and their systems communicate too. Take a closer look at your computer, you’ll realize there’s not much difference. There are quite a number of pieces of software and hardware that require communicating with each other right from the moment you put them on your system. Your application is reacting to the click on your mouse or to a keyboard typing or even the mic when using voice commands and control. The computer system can read files right from your disk storage and so on. At the end of the day,the machine understands nothing but bits, 1s, and 0s, the combination of which creates meaning that you the user desire.So what is a programming language? A programming language is the set of instructions through which humans interact with computers. In other to write a program, you’ll need codes. Special pieces of software exist that turn the code you input into machine language that the machine understands. The code is are pretty much like writing a paragraph of instruction or creating a to-do list for computers. With these codes and programming, you get the computer to draw complex shapes and create rich computer graphics, and then create programs that understand game mechanics and help you build games that feel real with gravity and particle collision, with these programs you can create the most intense and immersive games of all sorts.
According to this Portuguese research in which no other research has countered as at the time of writing this, “C” is by far the greenest programming language. Most people take for granted the fact that a computer program that runs faster or is easier will consume less energy. But this research has proven that might not always be true, as other factors enter into the power consumption equation besides speed. Moving on, if you ask around most developers know several programming languages, but take a deep dive into one or two. Learning a programming language and becoming an expert in it has proven to require time, patience and consistency. The type of software you want to develop may also be a consideration that influences which programming languages to learn. While no concrete rules apply for what language is compulsory to write what software, based on reports from developers who have become experts at it, we offer you considerable guidance.Web-based applications are more likely to be programmed using Python and JavaScript. Large corporations depend on C#, Java to develop their internal applications while their Web applications depend on PHP. Programming for data analytics typically depends on R and MATLAB languages. Embedded devices, such as those in the automotive and healthcare industries, run software written in C, C++, or Rust. Applications that run on the cloud are increasingly written in Go or Scala.  Mobile applications are increasingly written in Swift or Kotlin. As surprising as this discovery of environmentally friendly programming languages may seem to us now, it leaves upcoming and expert developers with one big question, “Will your choice of programming language ever be influenced by energy consumption?”",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542831371-29b0f74f9713?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxjb2xsZWN0aW9uLXBhZ2V8MXwyNTc0MjA0MXx8ZW58MHx8fHw%3D&w=1000&q=80,techbooky

That said, the 27-inch iMac was reportedly still available after last spring’s event that then introduced the 24-inch M1 iMac. At the time, there wasn’t really an option for people whose choice desktop screens were the larger ones.Another point worthy of note is that the 27-inch Studio Display can be connected to any Mac. Apple has seemingly felt the urge that there wouldn’t be a need for a large-sized all-in-one desktop computer. Now that the 27-inch iMac is being retired, for now, the 24-inch ‌iMac‌ remains the only all-in-one desktop computer offered by Apple. There is a major gap, however, between the 24-inch iMac, which starts at $1,299, and an M1 Mac mini or Mac Studio paired with the Studio Display. The former starts at $2,298, and the latter starts at $3,598. Rumours say that a larger iMac powered by Apple Silicon may be in the works, but when it will debut is still in the air. This isn’t the last Intel-powered Mac, for now, Apple still keeps the Mac Pro around, as well as the Intel Mac Mini.According to reports making rounds, Apple has now removed the 27-inch iMac from its website. For those who can’t wait to see if Apple brings a more professionally-oriented iMac to its lineup later this year and also aren’t interested in the new Mac Studio, the 27-inch iMac may still be purchased directly from the company’s online store, although options are light.",https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/goD0ICwQKNM-S2bfiqVRYXQA8iQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x800/filters:focal(857x517:1183x843)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70595665/DSC01539.0.jpg?ssl=1,techbooky
technology,Understanding US President- Joe Biden’s Cryptocurrency Executive Order,March 9,"Earlier today, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing agencies across the federal government to consider new regulations for digital currencies. Biden calls on agencies across the Federal Government to coordinate these efforts in order to gauge the benefits and risks posed by cryptocurrency ownership, and whether to create an American digital currency. This highly anticipated executive order on digital assets by the US President appears to take a supportive stance toward the industry.The new order is one of the biggest and most comprehensive efforts the Biden administration is showing to regulate an industry that is growing rapidly. This is as close to an embrace of crypto by the Biden administration. These significant efforts by Mr President have been identified as would encourage innovation that would identify and most importantly mitigate the risks to consumers, investors, business and the American economy. The order, titled “Ensuring Responsible Development if Digital Assets,” outlined the risks cryptocurrencies pose to the economy but most importantly noted their possible benefits.Biden’s executive order revolves around six priorities majorly, they are “consumer and investor protection; financial stability; illicit finance; U.S. leadership in the global financial system and economic competitiveness; financial inclusion; and responsible innovation.”The executive order by the White House has instructed various government agencies, including the Commerce and Treasury departments, to wake up to federal approaches to regulating digital assets. It also asks agencies to review the possibility of issuing digital versions of the dollar, tasking the Justice department with assessing if it would require new legislation and possibly preparing such legislation. Director of Biden’s National Economic Council, Brian Deese while making a statement said that “We need a comprehensive, all-of-government framework to address the emerging risks and opportunities that digital assets pose.”Bitcoin which has become one of the most common forms of cryptocurrencies globally, Bitcoin saw its jump by the dollar value of about 9% to $42,300, on track for its largest percentage gain since Feb. 28 according to Coin Metrics. Ether, the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network wasn’t left behind as it added 6.3% to $2,740, also set for its best day this month. “We applaud the White House for recognizing this as a defining moment for U.S. innovation on the world stage,” said Faryar Shirzad, chief policy officer at the largest U.S. crypto exchange, Coinbase Global Inc., in a series of tweets.The executive order has called on the Department of Treasury to assess and come up with policy recommendations and also encourages the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify risks and develop policy recommendations on regulatory gaps, and it calls for a focus on coordinated action across federal agencies to prevent illicit finance and national security risks.",https://i0.wp.com/static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/exec-order1.jpg?ssl=1,techbooky

entertainment,Archana Puran Singh responds to memes after Navjot Singh Sidhu’s defeat: ‘This is at my expense more than Sidhu’s’,March 12,"Actor and TV personality Archana Puran Singh, best known for playing the role of Miss Braganza in the film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, is now seen as the permanent guest on The Kapil Sharma Show. She had famously stepped in when the show’s former guest, Navjot Singh Sidhu, bowed out in 2019.Earlier this week, Archana started trending after the politician’s defeat in the recently concluded Assembly elections in Punjab.Social media sites were flooded by memes and jokes about how her Sidhu may return to claim his seat on Kapil’s show. She has now responded to memes about Navjot Singh Sidhu.Soon after Sidhu’s defeat, the Twitteratti joked that Archana’s job in The Kapil Sharma is in crisis and she is the saddest person over the cricketer-turned politician’s defeat. This has also been a running gag on the show, with the sketch comedy’s characters taking pot-shots at Archana for ‘dethroning Sidhu’.Responding to the jokes and memes, Archana said (as per the Times of India), “I retweeted the funny and hilarious memes on Navjot Singh Sidhu. I really loved all the jokes like the second time he has lost a seat, first time he lost to Archana Puran Singh. I like all kinds of humour. This is at my expense more than Sidhu’s. There was another ‘Archana ji, aap ki Kursi khatre mein hain’ (Archana, your chair is in danger). I take all these jokes with a pinch of salt.”Sidhu, a Congress leader, lost to AAP leader Jeevanjot Kaur by 5129 votes in what has been termed a huge upset. Archana had replaced Sidhu in 2019 after the latter’s comments on Pulwama terror attack that evoked controversy. Sidhu had said that nations cannot be held responsible “for the dastardly acts of terrorists” in the context of Pulwama attack, and that terrorists have no religion.Archana added that if the jokes turn out to be true and she really were to lose her seat on the show to Sidhu she won’t care. “It could very well be that he could come back on the seat. That’s great for him. I always move on. I’ve done Comedy Circus for so many years. If this doesn’t happen something else will. We are professionals and artists, we have to do something or the other. I’ve worked with Kapil for 10 years now and it has been a great ride,” said Archana Puran Singh.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/03/archana-puran-singh-navjot-singh-sidhu-1200.jpg,indian express

entertainment,When Shah Rukh Khan said Atif Aslam was too busy to sing for his film: ‘I would love to sing for you any day…’,March 13,"Pakistani singer Atif Aslam is a sensation in his own right. He has a massive fan base in the Indian subcontinent, and has consistently churned out chartbusters — peppy ones, soulful ones, romantic ballads — since the beginning of his career in 2003. He began his career with the band Jal and later broke away to forge his own path as a solo artiste.Atif got his first breakthrough in Bollywood, thanks to Mahesh Bhatt who apparently had approached him for his consent to include one of his tracks for his production venture Zeher in 2005. The result was the slow, romantic song “Woh Lamhey.” Post the warm, resounding welcome of “Woh Lamhey” by Indian fans, Atif continued to lend his voice to many songs over the years until the India-Pakistan tension escalated in 2016.Contemporary Bollywood sound and Atif Aslam share a symbiotic relationship almost. Both have taken something from the other and grown, in turn.In an interview with BBC’s Haroon Rashid a while back, Atif acknowledged the same and said, “I loved that journey, because it has taught me how to be more humble, and how to be more creative and patient.” However, not everything was hunky-dory since the singer admitted there were occasions when he had to make changes to his products because the producers had issues with it — “Few songs I had to change the lyrics for. I really felt bad about it. I did not want to do that, but yes, I had to (do it). There is a difference in doing your own work, and doing it for somebody else.”Further adding that he doesn’t regret anything that he did during his time recording music for the film industry, Atif said, “I don’t look back and regret, that oh my god, I could have sung ‘Chashni’ and all of that…I have worked the most over there (India), and I have enjoyed myself thoroughly. The love that I have gotten from there, I still have it. My heart still has it. It can never be bittersweet, because I am a firm believer in the fact that, if something is for me, it will come to me. It was not in my control not to sing for Bollywood movies. It was meant to be like this.”Later in the interview, the beloved singer opened about one particular Bollywood association that almost happened between him and superstar Shah Rukh Khan. Apparently, Shah Rukh had claimed that he had approached Aslam to sing “Gerua” for Dilwale, but it never panned out. When asked to elaborate upon it, Atif laughed and said, “I have just come across him once in my life, and he is a wonderful person. But he never said it personally. His team got in touch with us, and we recorded the song, and we had sent back the song. I don’t know what happened, his team did not put us through. Something happened which was not conveyed to him. And the next thing I see is him saying ‘Atif Aslam was not available for my song. Maybe he was too busy singing for a Chinese film.’ If Shah Rukh Khan watches this, (I want to say) I was not busy. I would never be busy for you. I would love to sing for you, any day.”
Fingers crossed for this potential iconic collaboration.

entertainment,‘Stop judging a woman based on hemlines and necklines’: Samantha Ruth Prabhu pens powerful note after her red carpet appearance,March 13,"Samantha Ruth Prabhu on Saturday penned a note talking about how women are easily judged for the dress they wear, the race they belong to or even their skin tone. She asked people to focus on “bettering” themselves instead of passing remarks about women based on their hemlines and necklines.“As a woman, I bear firsthand knowledge of what it means to be judged. We judge women based on what they wear, their race, education, social standing, appearance, skin tone and the list goes on and on. Making snap judgements about a person simply based on the clothes they wear is quite literally the easiest thing one can do.“Now that we’re in the year 2022 – can we finally stop judging a woman based on the hemlines and necklines she adorns and focus instead on bettering ourselves? Turning that judgement inward and training it on ones own self is evolution. Projecting our ideals on someone else never did anyone any good. Let’s gently rewrite the way we measure and understand a person,” Samantha‘s note read.Samantha’s post came a few days after she made a stunning appearance at an award show in Mumbai where she wore a bottle green dress.Samantha is not the only one who was judged for her costumes. Deepika Padukone, during the promotions of Gehraiyaan, had to face something similar. Earlier this year, influencer Freddy Birdy took a jibe at the actor’s clothes during the Gehraiyaan promotions. Freddy had shared a post on Instagram, which read, “Newton’s Law of Bollywood. The clothes will get tinier as the Gehraiyyan release date approaches.” A part of the caption read, “Necklines and hemlines are Gehraiyaan.” In a cryptic tweet which was widely seen as a response, Deepika had written, “Scientists say the universe is made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. They forgot to mention morons.”",https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/03/Samanha.jpg,indian express
sports,Watch: Confusion Reigns Supreme In Mayank Agarwal's Bizarre Run Out In India vs Sri Lanka 2nd Test,March 12,"Mayank Agarwal was run out for 4 in the 2nd Test vs Sri Lanka.Mayank Agarwal's homecoming did not go according to plan as a big mix-up with captain Rohit Sharma ended his first Test match innings at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru for 4. Confusion reigned supreme in the fourth ball of the second over of the second and final Test match against Sri Lanka. Left-arm seamer Vishwa Fernando got the pink ball to nip back slightly. Mayank got himself in a bit of a tangle and the ball appeared to have hit his pad first. The Sri Lankans went up in a big appeal but the umpire did not seem convinced. While all this was happening, Mayank tried to sneak in a single without noticing that Praveen Jayawickrama, who was moving in from point to covers, had almost collected the ball. Rohit at the other end sent Mayank back but the right-hander had charged too far down the wicket. Jayawickrama just lobbed it back towards Sri Lanka keeper Niroshan Dickwella with Mayank having no chance to return to the crease on time.Watch: Mayank Agarwal's Innings Ends Early After He Gets Run Out In Bizarre Fashion vs Sri Lanka:The drama, however, did not end there. Dickwella, for some strange reason, before whipping the bails off, started to signal for the review. He took the bails off a moment later and made the 'T' signal again but the third umpire informed that Fernando had overstepped. Since it was a no ball, there was no point in even considering the LBW appeal but the run out stood and Mayank took the long walk back to the pavilion after scoring just 4.Earlier, Rohit won the toss and opted to bat first in the third pink ball day-night Test in India. The hosts made one change, bringing in a fit-again Axar Patel in place of Jayant Thakur in the playing XI.Sri Lanka, on the other hand, were forced to make two changes with Kusal Mendis and Praveen Jayawickrama replacing Pathum Nissanka and Lahiru Kumara, who were ruled out due to injuries.
India won the first Test by an innings and 222 runs.

politics,Congress Elections May Be Advanced At Meet Tomorrow After Poll Disaster,March 13,"New Delhi: The Congress's top decision-making body, the Congress Working Committee or CWC, will meet at 4 pm tomorrow, three days after a huge defeat in state polls, and is likely to advance internal elections scheduled in September amid renewed questions about its leadership, sources said on Saturday.The Congress faced a wipe-out in state election results declared on Thursday, losing Punjab, one of the last major states under its control, to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), and failing to put up a strong fight in three other states where it had hoped for a comeback - Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.In Uttar Pradesh, where the campaign was led by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, party chief Sonia Gandhi's daughter and sister to senior leader Rahul Gandhi, the Congress got just 2 seats out of 403, a loss of 5 over the last polls. The party got just 2.4 per cent of the vote.The defeat revived searing criticism of the Gandhi family and growing clamour for a complete overhaul and a leadership change by number of party leaders - a demand that was so far confined to the ""G-23"" or group of 23 ""dissenters"" who had written to Sonia Gandhi two years ago.""There will be no course correction,"" said senior Congress leaders, who are speaking out within the party against the Gandhis' leadership but do not want to come on record.Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, a member of the G-23, on Thursday, had tweeted the party could not avoid change while his colleague Jaiveer Shergill appealed for reform and warned against ""sugar-coating"" the loss.Some of the dissidents met at veteran leader Ghulam Nabi Azad's home last evening and reportedly discussed the way forward, expressing dismay at the Congress leadership for not taking any corrective steps to revive the party.They also reportedly expressed concern that the report of the committee formed to evaluate the losses after the last round of assembly poll defeat in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala and Puducherry were not even discussed in the party.However, Gandhi family loyalists have defended the leadership. In an interview with NDTV, the party's top troubleshooter DK Shivakumar on Friday said the Congress cannot be united without its first family and it was ""impossible"" for it to survive without them.""Without the Gandhi family, the Congress party cannot stay united. They are key for the unity of the Congress party... It is impossible for the Congress to survive without the Gandhi family,"" the party's Karnataka unit chief said.",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/qg2vv4s8_image_640x480_12_March_22.png,ndtv
entertainment,Actor Sonam Kapoor's Father-In-Law's Firm Cheated Of ₹ 27 Crore,March 12,"Faridabad: The Faridabad police has busted a gang of highly-sophisticated cybercriminals involved in duping an export-import firm of the father-in-law of film actor Sonam Kapoor here of over ₹ 27 crore.Police on Friday said the tricksters had been duping Ms Kapoor's father-in-law Harish Ahuja's Faridabad-based firm, Shahi Export Factory, by misappropriating Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies licences, meant for his firm, on the basis of his forged Digital Signature Certificate and encashing them.Explaining the modus operandi of the highly innovative cyber fraud, Faridabad Deputy Commissioner of Police (Headquarters) Nitish Agarwal said the government gives some incentives to export firms in the form of ROSCTL licences, entitling them to some rebate in the excise and customs duties.These ROSCTL licences happen to be akin to digital coupons worth several lakh rupees entitling the firm to get rebates in taxes and duties, the DCP said, adding the fraudsters had secured a total of 154 ROSCTLs worth ₹ 27.61 crore of Ahuja's firm and had been transferring them to fake and fictitious firms opened by them and encashing them.They also used to get these coupons encashed by transferring them to other firms, DCP Agarwal said.
He said working silently on the complaint of Ahuja's firm since July last year, the Faridabad police has arrested a total of nine accused from different places in the country, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Karnataka.The last arrest was made on December 23 last year, the officer said, adding some of the accused included former clerks and employees of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade, well-versed in the technicalities and working of the DGFT.The DCP identified the arrested accused as Delhi residents Manoj Rana, Manish Kumar, Praveen Kumar, Lalit Kumar Jain and Manish Kumar Moga besides Bhusan Kishan Thakur of Mumbai and Suresh Kumar Jain of Chennai.Two others arrested in the scam were identified as Ganesh Parsuram of Raichur in Karnataka, Rahul Raghunath of Raigadh and Santosh Sitaram of Pune.Mr Agarwal said accused Manoj Rana, Manish Kumar, Praveen Kumar and Manish Kumar Moga had earlier worked as clerks in the DGFT and were well-versed in the functioning of the directorate.

Batting first, Mandhana (119 off 123 balls) and Kaur (109 off 107 balls) stitched a 184-run stand to power India to their highest World Cup score, 317 for eight.

The 35-year-old has made the most of a recall to the national side, missing out on a hundred in the first Test at Rawalpindi by three runs after scoring centuries in both innings in his return match against England. His unbeaten 127 included 13 boundaries and a six with Steve Smith (72) providing support at the other end until he fell to a sharp Hasan Ali delivery with seven balls left in the day.The ball made Smith play and barely carried to slip where Faheem Ashraf pounced to his left for a brilliant grab.Pakistan could have claimed another wicket on the day's final ball but Imam-ul-Haq put down nightwatchman Nathan Lyon at short leg off Shaheen Shah Afridi.Australian captain Pat Cummins won the toss and elected to bat on a dry pitch, and for a brief moment at the end of the first session, his decision appeared questionable when the visitors lost two quick wickets.All-rounder Faheem Ashraf -- recalled after missing the first Test due to injury -- snagged the first breakthrough, getting the ball to nip away and drawing an edge from David Warner (36) straight into the gloves of keeper Mohammad Rizwan.Marnus Labuschagne was run out for nought nine deliveries later. But from then till the second last over of the day Australia looked in complete control with Khawaja leading the charge.He pushed spinner Sajid Khan for a sharp single towards square leg to reach the landmark, punching the air to celebrate his tenth Test ton -- drawing applause from a crowd of 10,000 people at the National Stadium.He first put on a solid 82-run stand for the opening wicket with Warner, who looked dangerous and greeted Sajid into the attack with two sixes.Then Khawaja repaired the innings alongside Smith, who struck seven boundaries in a cautious 35th Test half century.The duo frustrated Pakistan's attack forcing spinners Nauman Ali and Sajid to resort to a negative leg-side line to contain the runs and only 36 were scored in the hour after tea in 17 overs.Pakistan skipper Babar Azam came on to bowl and used part-timer Azhar Ali on the other end to complete the 80 overs before the second new ball, with the score at 235-2.Australia made one change for the match, with leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson making his Test debut in place of pacer Josh Hazlewood, while Pakistan have brought in Hasan Ali and Ashraf.Australia are on their first tour of Pakistan since 1998, having previously refused to visit the country over security fears.The third and final Test is in Lahore from March 21-25.","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/tmpqhkuo_khawaja-afp_625x300_12_March_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605",ndtv sports

Chelsea owner Abramovich was one of seven more oligarchs sanctioned this week by the UK following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The European champions have been placed under tough restrictions due to the sanctions on Abramovich. Chelsea are unable to sign players, renew contracts or sell tickets to matches, with limits on the amount of money they are allowed to spend on travel to away games.Now Premier League chiefs have taken action against Abramovich, who is described by the government as part of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle despite his denials of any association.""Following the imposition of sanctions by the UK Government, the Premier League board has disqualified Roman Abramovich as a director of Chelsea Football Club,"" a Premier League statement said on Saturday.""The board's decision does not impact on the club's ability to train and play its fixtures, as set out under the terms of a licence issued by the Government, which expires on May 31 2022.""Abramovich had already announced his intention to sell Chelsea, with a host of potential buyers declaring their interest in a club that have won 19 major trophies since he bought the side in 2003.The government is still open to a sale but would have to approve a new licence, on the proviso no profit would go to the Russian, who has bankrolled the club to the tune of around £1.5 billion ($2 billion).Chelsea are already feeling the impact of the sanctions, with shirt sponsor Three suspending its £40 million deal.The club's official training wear partner Trivago said Friday that it was sticking with Chelsea despite the ""challenging"" situation.Chelsea reportedly saw several credit cards temporarily frozen on Friday while they negotiate the terms of their special operating license with the government.Thomas Tuchel's side host Newcastle on Sunday as they look to cement their hold on third place in the Premier League.","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/j4jsq1do_roman-abramovich-afp_625x300_12_March_22.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605",ndtv sports

Kohli, who walked out to a rousing reception from the Chinnaswamy crowd, was looking good till a delivery from off-spinner Dhananjaya de Silva kept lower than expected to hit his front pad. In the 28th over of India's innings, de Silva's short of a good length delivery turned and kept low, hitting Kohli just above the ankle region and the umpire had no hesitation in raising his finger. A shell-shocked Kohli, who was looking to turn the ball towards the on-side, did not even consider sending it upstairs and walked back after scoring 23 off 48 balls on Saturday.Reacting to Kohli's dismissal, Gavaskar said the talismanic right-hander perhaps could have avoided playing that particular shot.""Today you could say that the shot he played shouldn't have been played. The trajectory meant, he went on to the backfoot like the first Test in Mohali but this time he played across his front pad, which meant he was always going to struggle. If he missed it, he was always going to be a candidate for LBW, which is exactly what happened. He knew as soon as he missed and the ball hit his pads, he was right in front. He didn't even look for a referral. So, playing across the line cost him today,"" Gavaskar said in the post-Tea show on Star Sports.Gavaskar also gave credit to the Sri Lanka bowlers and added that the Chinnaswamy pitch was not an easy for the batters.""Sri Lankan bowlers have bowled well... Jayawickrama settled down after the first over. Every bowler is going to bowl the odd loose ball but they've stuck to their task well. The ball is gripping and turning so it isn't gonna be easy for the batters,"" Gavaskar added.Former India bowler Ajit Agarkar said there's ""very little"" that Kohli could have done with that delivery.""There's very little that he could've done. That partnership with Hanuma Vihari was good. They put a li'll bit of pressure. They cashed in whenever there was an opportunity. You generally try and play off the backfoot when the ball is spinning but that once just kept low and he had no chance,"" Agarkar said.India were bowled out for 252. Shreyas Iyer top-scored with 92.

Labh Singh, a small-time mobile shop owner and an unlikely candidate, took on Channi and won by over 37,000 votes.Although Labh Singh has now shot to fame with the win, his mother, Baldev Kaur, will continue her humble job of a contractual sweeper at a government school in their native Ugoke village in Barnala district. In her late fifties, Baldev Kaur says she has categorically told her MLA son that she won’t give up her job.“The jhadu (broom) was with us when it was a compulsion to run the household and now that jhadu has given us instant recognition with our son winning the assembly election, it will remain a part of our life,” she said.Baldev took everyone by surprise when she showed up for work on March 11, a day after her son Labh Singh emerged as the AAP candidate who defeated the sitting chief minister and was on his way to Mohali to attend the legislative party meeting where Bhagwant Mann was elected AAP legislative party leader.“I am extremely happy that my son has achieved this victory, that too by defeating the sitting chief minister but I will continue to discharge my duty. For me, it is a way of life. My earnings from the job help run the household,” Baldev said.Coming from a humble background, Labh Singh defied the perception that only the rich or those from a political family can afford to contest election. His father is a driver, his wife a seamstress, and he ran a mobile repair shop before he joined the AAP as a volunteer in 2013. Since their family did not have finances needed for election campaign, their friends and well-wishers pitched in.

politics,Sauer: Biden Is Playing for the Midterms Instead of the American Economy,March 10,"US Policy Editor Charles Sauer has a new article out in Townhall on the State of the Union address and the inclusion of anti-innovation practices like price setting.
Here’s an excerpt.“When the international community slapped sanctions on Putin’s Russia, many people cheered. Bad things were going to start happening to a bad country. However, with rampant inflation and a domestic energy sector that had already been attacked by the reckless Biden Administration, the effect on the American economy is likely going to be harmful as well. Now, in defense of the Ukrainian people and greater stability in the world, that harm might be worth it, but the pain that we are all about to experience didn’t have to be this bad. And, looking around at the rest of the Biden agenda – he seems to be using the same playbook and making many similar mistakes. The public policies that the President announced at Tuesday’s State of the Union will slow innovation and investment – which means that responding to the next emergency will be even harder. When COVID-19 was unleashed, a vaccine was developed in days. That development is thanks to the fact that in the U.S. we enjoy a robust, competitive research and development economy with strong rule of law to protect innovators. In fact, not just one vaccine was developed, but multiple vaccines. This wasn’t an accident, the founders of our great country understood the benefits of an innovative society – including patents as the only explicit right in the Constitution, and inventors and innovators are an important piece of nation’s history. The reason for this competitive market comes down to two factors. First, we have patents in the US which entitle the inventor of a new “thing,” in this case a new drug, the exclusive right to that invention for 20 years. Second, the companies that produce these drugs are allowed to price their new drugs and sell them to willing and thankful buyers. 

However, in the President’s State of the Union, and other speeches that he has given around the country, the President has called for setting the prices of drugs – like insulin. This idea sounds good on its face for winning short-term political points, but it undercuts the two principles that have made the US the innovative economy that it is by lowering the value of patents – and restricting the ability of pharmaceutical companies to profit. 

This lowers the incentive of investors to invest and inventors to invent – which means that the next time the country is facing an emergency – the research and development industry won’t be as robust, it won’t be as prepared, it won’t be as aggressive. 

It isn’t just big pharmaceutical companies; this change also harms the small inventor. When the large companies can’t be assured of profits from big breakthroughs, they are less likely to buy innovations from smaller innovators.”",https://uspolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AdobeStock_391086093-696x461.jpeg,US policy
politics,Mamata names Shatrughan Sinha and Babul Supriyo as TMC candidates for bypolls,March `13,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday named Shatrughan Sinha as TMC's candidate for by-poll to Asansol parliamentary seat, and Babul Supriyo as nominee for Ballygunge assembly by-election. The Asansol seat was vacated by Supriyo, a former Union minister, after he quit the saffron party last year and joined the TMC.

The Ballygunge assembly seat fell vacant following the demise of state minister Subrata Mukherjee.

""Happy to announce on behalf of the All India Trina ..
Supriyo, in response, thanked Banerjee for providing him with the opportunity to serve people.

""I want to thank Didi for allowing me to serve the people of the state. I am grateful to her and would work for the development of the state,"" Supriyo told PTI.

The former BJP MP had joined the TMC last year, just months after he was dropped as a minister following a union ministry reshuffle.

Sinha, however, could not be reached for comment.

health,Partnerships for Care Integration to Ensure Continuum of Care Across Health Systems in Uttar Pradesh,March 3,"In Uttar Pradesh, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) is increasing focus on how to leverage public and private health systems, programs, and schemes, to offer a better experience to the beneficiary. 

Since its implementation in September 2018, the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) has gathered strength in moving towards the goal of providing universal health coverage in Uttar Pradesh. After the first phase of implementation, there is an increasing focus on how to leverage the public and private health systems, programs, and schemes to offer a better experience for the PM-JAY beneficiary.

The State Agency for Comprehensive Health & Integrated Services (SACHIS) which implements the scheme in Uttar Pradesh, organized a discussion in partnership with the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Department of Medical Education, and National Health Mission, to identify possible opportunities in improving coordination and implementation.

The discussion facilitated by ACCESS Health was chaired by Mr. Pranjal Yadav, Secretary, Medical Health and Family Welfare with participation from Mrs. Sangeeta Singh, CEO, SACHIS, Dr. Vedvrat Singh, Director General (DG), Department of Medical Health, Dr. Lily Singh, DG, Department of Family Welfare, Dr N.C. Prajapati, DG, Department of Medical Education, and Dr. Rajesh Jha, General Manager, Community Process, National Health Mission.

The discussion acknowledged that participation of the public sector hospitals and institutions in PM-JAY can improve access to care, however, increasing the quality and patient experience is of critical importance. At present, there is little motivation for the beneficiary to use the PM-JAY cover in a public hospital as they are entitled to free care in these facilities. Also, there is a preference for seeking healthcare in private hospitals. Hence the need of the hour is to increase the value proposition of care through an integrated, beneficiary-centric system.

health,Local and Vocal: How a Community Radio Pilot Helped Generate Buzz Around PM-JAY,Feb 3,"Munni Devi* of Meerut district in Uttar Pradesh was losing her eyesight and was advised a surgery by her doctors. She didn’t have the money for the procedure and was in despair. That’s when she heard about the free cashless treatments provided under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) on the local radio channel Radio IIMT. Munni sought the help of the radio bhaiyya to know more about the scheme, and the station also helped her enroll as a beneficiary. Once an Ayushman card was issued to her, she got treated for her eye problem at a hospital, in a free and cashless transaction.

Scores of people like Munni tune into their local radio stations to listen to local musicians and programs addressing local issues and events. The hyperlocal medium, with radio jockeys (RJs) bantering in regional dialects, makes educational material relatable for listeners, giving community radio networks a far better reach into the beneficiary base of PM-JAY compared to newspapers and mainstream television programs. Community radio networks are also accountable to the community, as they are part of it and know the local issues and concerns. Which is what made community radio networks effective partners for generating awareness on PM-JAY in Uttar Pradesh.

Four districts with five radio stations were selected for the pilot which ran from September to December 2021. To steer the community radio pilot, ACCESS Health with support from the Gates Foundation, facilitated a partnership with SMART, an organization that works with community radio stations to enhance the capacities of listeners by providing them information on government schemes and development programs that help increase their access to health, education, and livelihood. SMART aims to democratize information through the radio, supplemented with a strong and sustained on-ground community engagement. Star RJs with maximum air time and listener following on these radio networks were engaged and trained for the project.",https://accessh.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Community-radio-2.jpg,Access health internationals
health,"Covid Can Shrink Brain As Much As Decade Of Aging, Claims Study",March 8,"Researchers identified Covid-associated brain damage months after infection, including in the region linked to smell, and shrinkage in size equivalent to a decade of normal aging. In the study, the changes were linked to cognitive decline.Even a mild case of Covid-19 can damage the brain and addle thinking, scientists found in a study that highlights the illness's alarming impact on mental function.
Researchers identified Covid-associated brain damage months after infection, including in the region linked to smell, and shrinkage in size equivalent to as much as a decade of normal aging. The changes were linked to cognitive decline in the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature.

The findings represent striking evidence of the virus's impact on the central nervous system. More research will be required to understand whether the evidence from the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging at the University of Oxford means Covid-19 will exacerbate the global burden of dementia -- which cost an estimated $1.3 trillion in the year the pandemic began -- and other neurodegenerative conditions.

""It is a very novel study with conclusive data,"" said Avindra Nath, clinical director of the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, who wasn't involved in the research. ""The findings are very intriguing, with important implications for the population at large.""

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is widely considered a respiratory pathogen that attacks the lungs. Taking a narrow view of it, however, misses myriad neurologic complications -- including confusion, stroke, and neuromuscular disorders -- that manifest during the acute phase of the illness. Other effects like impaired concentration, headache, sensory disturbances, depression, and even psychosis may persist for months as part of a constellation of symptoms termed long Covid.

To investigate changes in the brain, neuroscientist Gwenaelle Douaud and colleagues leveraged the world's largest magnetic resonance imaging database. Initial MRI scans of the brains of 785 volunteers were taken before the pandemic began as part of U.K. Biobank research, which marries large-scale genomic and detailed clinical data for half a million people.

A subsequent scan was taken an average of 38 months later. By then, 401 participants had tested positive for Covid. The uninfected remainder served as a control group that was similar to the survivors in age, sex, and many risk factors, including blood pressure, obesity, smoking, socio-economic status and diabetes. The participants in the study, aged 51 to 81, were mostly Caucasian.",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/3gjjt5r_covid-patient-bloomberg_625x300_08_March_22.jpg,ndtv

Education,IIT Madras researchers develop new technique to provide high-resolution ultrasound images,March 13,"Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras have developed a new technique that can provide a clear and high-quality visualisation through reconstructed ultrasound image. The research could facilitate better diagnosis of diseases, detection of minute abnormalities and better real-time image-guided biopsy procedures and treatment monitoring applications.

Ultrasound imaging technique is used to capture real-time images inside the human body. It has a wide range of clinical applications in diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. The technique is widely used to diagnose the cause of pain, swelling and infection in internal organs and to examine foetus in pregnant women.

The main component of an ultrasound machine is a “beamformer”, which plays a major role in the final reconstructed image quality. Over the years, there have been several techniques identified to improve the quality of the reconstructed image by changing the beamformer.The team claims to have developed a new beamforming technique, which is demonstrated to outperform other existing techniques and yields the best image resolution throughout the field of view. The findings of their research have been published in a peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports.

“This research could potentially facilitate several applications like early detection and better diagnosis of diseases, detection of minute abnormalities within human body like renal stones, better real-time image-guided biopsy procedures and treatment monitoring applications,” Arun K Thittai, Professor, Department of Applied Mechanics, IIT Madras, told PTI.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/03/IIT-Madras-1.jpg,the indian express

However, the CBSE class 10 term-1 results were declared with a twist this time. Meanwhile, several other state boards such as BSEB, HPBOSE, WBCHSE, UP Board and more also released several notifications regarding datesheets, answer keys, revision of exam schedule and more.

Several important notifications from NEET were also released this week, and results for UCEED, CEED, and registrations for other competitive exams also opened. A lot happened in education this week — here’s a recap:

One of the biggest things that happened in the education sector this week was the announcement of class 10 board results. However, this was done with a twist. On Friday night, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) released the class 10 term-1 results. This time, the result has been declared offline and has not been uploaded on the official websites. Students have to collect their term 1 marksheets from respective schools. Due to this, students told indianexpress.com that they missed the fun of checking their scores online with friends and family.This week, CBSE also announced the datesheet for term-II exams for classes 10 and 12. The exams for both classes will begin on April 26. Students can check the datesheet for board exams on the official CBSE website — cbse.gov.in, cbseresults.nic.in. The Board has made sure that the CBSE Term-II datesheet for Class 12 is designed in such a way that students can easily attempt the JEE Main 2022 exams in May 2022. The exam dates do not clash with any JEE exam and suitable gaps have been provided between each exam.

CBSE has also issued a notice against a fake notification that had been doing rounds on various social media platforms regarding announcement of class 12 term-I board exam results. The fake notice stated that the CBSE Term-1 results will be announced on March 11 at 2 pm. The board has issued a statement stating that this information is fake.The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay released the result for UCEED 2022 through the official website — uceed.iitb.ac.in. The exam had taken place on January 23, 2022 and the first counselling round is scheduled to begin on April 10, 2022.

The charm is lost and it being declared just one month before the term 2 board exams has given us very little time to think about it or even celebrate it. Nonetheless, I am happy with my result and am setting new targets for myself to achieve in term 2,” Deepika Goswami, a Class 10 student at Seth Anandram Jaipuria School in Vasundhara, told indianexpress.com.Another class 10 student from Chandigarh, Gurkirat Kaur said, “My brother passed class 10 in 2019 and I witnessed the excitement and rush of board results declaration at our home. I was looking forward to experiencing the same but with marks being sent to schools, I will have to wait a few more months until final result declaration to live that experience.”While some schools informed students about their term-1 theory marks immediately after receiving the results from CBSE, others have said they will distribute the marksheets after adding the practical marks.

Seema Kaur, the principal of Pacific World School in Noida, said that the school shared the individual marksheets with the parents immediately upon receiving the results.

“There is a different charm of checking the board result on the website and parents were trying to log in to the website in the morning.

business,Cash-rich states create ‘competitive environment’ with flurry of tax cuts,March 12,"There’s been a wave of state-level tax cuts spurred by budget surpluses, and more breaks may be coming, according to policy experts.

“States have a lot of revenue on hand and they are looking to return it to taxpayers,” said Katherine Loughead, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation.

In 2021, 29 states and the District of Columbia enacted “significant” cuts, according to the Tax Policy Center, typically through reduced individual rates or expanded earned income tax credits, a write-off for low- to moderate-income families.And this year, at least a dozen states have made cuts or are eyeing reductions, including both temporary and permanent measures, according to the Tax Foundation.  

While there have been some pushes for corporate or property tax relief, income taxes are “the heart of what’s going on,” said Richard Auxier, senior policy associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

“Overall, most of the tax cut proposals have been relatively modest, and a number have been targeted,” said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers.“The targeted proposals we’re seeing are directed towards helping with the impacts of the pandemic and inflation,” he said.

For example, some of these have included changes to grocery taxes, levies on retirement benefits, earned income credits, small business relief, pausing gas taxes and more.

Annual inflation grew by 7.9% in February, a new 40-year high, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, measuring the costs of food, gas, housing and more.

And “very uncomfortably high” inflation will likely last for another year, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107027881-1646852805478-gettyimages-1366673942-002a1219.jpeg?v=1646852843&w=740&h=416,cnbc

business,All you need to know about US Prez Joe Biden’s crypto executive order,March 11,"US President Joe Biden on March 10 signed the ‘Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets.’ The executive order is the first comprehensive set of rules for governing cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets in the US.

The country is now home to over 35 percent of Bitcoin’s mining volume capacity and to over 100 million cryptocurrency investors through its various cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.The executive order is widely being seen as being ‘neutral’ towards digital currencies as the regulations and orders do not seem to be setting the stage for a potential ban of all virtual currencies.
